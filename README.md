BST Login_System

The login system uses binary search tree algorithm to locate and storage data relevant to each user. Credientials such as username and passwords are attached via the node User and is recalled each time this information needs to be verified or checked.

Usernames are not case sensitive because users with different variations can create and store data without conflict.
Passwords on the other hand is case sensitive and must matched exactly or else the system considers the verification incorrect.

This interface is intended to be used for login purposes and protects users and their data. A membership system, if you will, and it has potentials to be integrated into any systems.
